name: ck:brainstorm
description: Explore and debate solutions before writing code. Use when the user poses a design question, asks "how should I approach X", wants to think through options before committing, or says anything like "let's brainstorm", "what's the best way to...", "I'm not sure how to tackle this", or "should I use X or Y". Always runs before /ck:plan for novel or ambiguous features. No code is written — only: explore → clarify → spec → report.

# ck:brainstorm — Surface Ideas, Then Decide

**Hard gate: zero implementation code.** Only explore → expand → spec → report.
Implementation happens later via `/ck:plan → /ck:cook`.

---

### Step 0 — Listen First

Do NOT scout the codebase yet. Do NOT present options yet.

Ask one open question to understand the user's existing thinking:

> "What directions are you already leaning toward — even loosely?"

Wait for their answer. Understand their mental model before adding yours.

```
// Listen before scouting.
// The user's intuition is the starting point, not a blank slate.
```

---

### Step 1 — Draw Out Ideas

Use `AskUserQuestion` to surface the user's thinking. Ask 1–2 questions per turn — never all at once.

Focus on **generative** questions:

- What approaches have you considered, even ones you've dismissed?
- What would the ideal outcome look like if there were no constraints?
- Is there a simpler version that would still solve the core problem?
- What's the one thing you're most uncertain about?

Add your own perspective after the user speaks — suggest angles they haven't mentioned, framed as possibilities, not recommendations.

Loop until the idea space feels explored and the user has expressed a preference or direction.

```
// User ideas first → Claude expands → iterate
// Aim for breadth (4–6 directions sketched lightly), not depth on one
```

---

### Step 2 — Scout (Only If Needed)

If a specific question from Step 1 requires codebase context, spawn 1–2 targeted **`Explore` sub-agents** inline.

```
// Scout is optional and reactive, not automatic.
// Only spawn if "I need to check X before we can evaluate Y."
```

---

### Step 3 — Narrow Together

Once the user signals interest in 1–2 directions, briefly compare them:

- What each does well for **this** project
- What it costs or risks
- Any hard incompatibilities with the existing codebase

Be direct. If one option is over-engineered or a poor fit, say so. The user drives the final call.

```
// Option A: [name] — [one-liner]
//   ✓ [specific upside]
//   ✗ [real cost]
//
// Option B: [name] — [one-liner]
//   ✓ ...
//   ✗ ...
```

---

### Step 4 — Clarification Gate

Before writing artifacts, scan the narrowed direction for ambiguity:

- Flag at most **3 items** with `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: <what's missing>]`
- Ask **1–2 targeted questions per turn** — stop when resolved or user signals "close enough"
- Red flags: no measurable success criteria, vague scale ("fast", "many users"), missing priority signal (MVP vs. nice-to-have)

Don't block on minor uncertainty. Mark it and move on.

```
// Clarification is cheap here; ambiguity in planning is expensive.
// Max 3 flags, max 5 questions total across the session.
```

---

### Step 5 — Write Artifacts

Write **two files**:

**A. Brainstorm report** → `plans/reports/YYMMDD-{slug}-brainstorm.md`

```markdown
# Brainstorm: {challenge}

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Ideas Explored
{All directions considered — even ones dismissed. 1–2 lines each.}

## User's Direction
{What the user leaned toward and why — in their words where possible}

## Open Questions
{Unresolved items that /ck:plan must address}

## Risks
{Top 2–3 risks worth watching}
```

**B. Spec file** → `plans/{slug}/spec.md` (from `.claude/skills/ck-brainstorm/references/spec-template.md`)

Fill in the template with what was established during Steps 0–4:
- Populate user stories with P1/P2/P3 from the narrowed direction
- Set measurable success criteria (numbers, not adjectives)
- Leave `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` for any unresolved flags

```
// spec.md is the living artifact — plan and cook will reference it.
// The brainstorm report is exploration narrative — context only.
```

---

### Step 6 — Handoff

Ask via `AskUserQuestion`:

**"Spec written at `plans/{slug}/spec.md`. What next?"**
- `→ /ck:plan plans/{slug}/spec.md` — proceed to planning
- `→ /ck:journal` — archive, no plan yet
- `Keep exploring` — return to Step 1 or Step 3
